The [prototype](https://rainbow-nc.netlify.app/) of another game of the NLP New Code - Rainbow: you need to say aloud the color that is written on the displayed card.
There is also a speech recognition here, if you need to play around with the accumulation of points.
In the console you can see what was heard by the speech recognition for self-testing. Good game!
